The Grew Versionchecker is a crucial script for the Grew Development Network.<br/>
It ensures that other scripts are up to date and provides notifications in the server console if outdated versions are detected.<br/>
With this script, you are always one step ahead and save yourself the hassle of constantly searching for updates manually!

## Functions
* Version check: Ensures all scripts in the Grew Development Network are up to date.
* Server console notification: Displays a message in the console if an outdated script is found.
* Prevents version conflicts: Ensures that no old versions of scripts are running, avoiding potential bugs or compatibility issues.

## Important
The version check will not take place unless the Grew Versionchecker is installed.<br/>
Without this script, outdated scripts may run unnoticed, increasing the risk of issues in the network.
