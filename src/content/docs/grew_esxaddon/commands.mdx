To unlock the full potential of the Grew esxAddon, this page provides an overview of the available commands and exports.<br/>
It is recommended to include the script as required in the `fxmanifest.lua` to ensure that exports are loaded smoothly and<br/>
available in all server-side files, allowing the addon to interact seamlessly with other server functions.

```lua
  dependency {
    'grew_esxAddon'
  }
```

If you have any questions about setting up or using the script, feel free to reach out. You can contact us via email or in the support channel on our Discord.<br/>

## Events
### triggerSyncServerCallback
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  This event triggers a synchronous callback on the server side. It waits for the callback to return a response before continuing the code execution.<br/>
  Useful for cases where you need a response from the server before proceeding with additional logic on the client side.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
  This example calls `triggerSyncServerCallback` to retrieve data from the server, waiting until a response is received:

  ```lua
    local result = exports["grew_esxAddon"]:triggerSyncServerCallback("exampleEvent", 1, "param1", "param2")
    
    if result then
        print("Server callback completed successfully!")
    else
        print("Server callback failed or timed out.")
    end
  ```
</details>

### triggerSyncClientCallback
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  This event triggers a synchronous callback on the client side.<br/>
  It waits for a response from the client before continuing execution on the server side, which is helpful in cases where server logic relies on client feedback.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>
  This example uses `triggerSyncClientCallback` to send a request from the server to the client, with a timeout mechanism in case of a delay:
  ``` lua
    local clientResult = triggerSyncClientCallback("exampleClientEvent", 1, "paramA", "paramB")

    if clientResult then
        print("Client callback returned data successfully!")
    else
        print("Client callback failed or timed out.")
    end
  ```
</details>
